    <h1>My name is Autumn</h1>
    <p>I'm taking computer related classes in the hope that it'll help me get the career I want. I have ADHD which can cause problems at times, but I'm trying to find ways to help with that. I tend to challenge myself and try to figure stuff out on my own; however, this usually only comes back to bite me later on.</p>
